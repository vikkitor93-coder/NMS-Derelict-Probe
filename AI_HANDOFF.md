# NMS Derelict Probe — AI handoff

## Current state

- Current source package: **v0.3.48**, transparent objective overlay update. Probe and NMS launch protocols are unchanged.
- Agent Console has four side-by-side lane cards. The fixed **NEEDED** box shows the published request, actual extension action, exact required prerequisite keys, and which prerequisites are currently missing. It does not contain generic step guidance. The actual host key is `probe.connected` (fresh probe heartbeat), not `probe.running`; the v1 extension contract is unchanged.
- Installed/published/reported versions remain immediately under NEEDED. Each evidence receipt checkbox stays fixed below its lane buttons.
- Compact top-right +/− controls collapse each major main-window section, each Agent Console card, lane action groups, and global action group. The controls and content begin expanded; lane/global buttons remain pinned in the bottom strip. Agent Console display toggles and refresh interval persist in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NMSDerelictSurveyor\agent-console-options.json`.
- Auto-refresh defaults to one minute; choices are 20 seconds, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, or Off. **Refresh now** fetches status and extension index immediately. Network reads run on background threads; cache-busted lane status requests remain read-only.
- Polling reuses unchanged extension widgets and action readiness uses the main window’s latest NMS/probe status instead of launching new process checks per lane, keeping scroll position stable and refresh work lighter.
- The overlay display toggles now live in the main Surveyor window; opacity and horizontal/vertical placement sliders apply live. Agent objectives come from the published status snapshot, and the overlay shows root-detected completion plus “waiting for upload / don’t close game” where applicable. `Root dispatch +0x10` still requires an explicit capture signal.
- Main Status and the in-game overlay now show the exact root resource path and observed event count. `Root dispatch +0x10` is shown separately and says it is not captured by the current standard probe; Runtime-A’s distinct live hook is still needed to produce that evidence.
- **Start overlay** and **Stop overlay** sit beside the existing **Game overlay** auto-start toggle. Stop closes the titled overlay window and signals the local stop-request file, including overlays started by the NMS launcher.
- The package carries DUNGEON-C 1.0.2, Metadata-D 1.0.1, Runtime-A 1.0.1, and Seed-B 1.0.2, with prior installed versions retained for rollback.

## Purpose and architecture

Reverse engineer No Man’s Sky abandoned-freighter generation using static and runtime evidence while keeping Surveyor independent from the game. `tools/surveyor_controller.py` is the Windows Tk app and action host; `mod/derelict_baseline_probe.py` collects read-only process evidence; `overlay/derelict_overlay.py` formats live status. `tools/agent_console.py` reads public GitHub lane status. `tools/agent_ui_extensions.py` validates and installs data-only JSON panels.

## Contracts, configuration, and diagnostics

- Start with `Start-Surveyor.cmd` / `Start-Surveyor.ps1`; Surveyor can run independently of NMS.
- Agent status uses schema v1 (`schema/agent-status-v1.schema.json`) from `agent-patches/<lane>/STATUS.json`; optional progress, blockers, extension version, and human-action fields are backward-compatible. Agent lanes publish status commits at meaningful milestones.
- Extension panels use shared UI host API 1.0 and hash-checked `manifest.json`/`panel.json` entries indexed by `agent-ui/extensions/index.json`. Extensions may call only registered host action IDs; no supplied shell or Python runs. Receipts are display-only and never lock actions.
- Session/live status schemas and probe/overlay command protocol remain v1. No data migration is required.
- Controller and workflow logs: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NMSDerelictSurveyor\gui-actions\`; live status: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NMSDerelictSurveyor\live-status.json`.
- Agent Console settings remain in its local options JSON. Overlay display settings live in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NMSDerelictSurveyor\overlay-settings.json`; the current objective snapshot is `overlay-objectives.json`.

## Build, run, and test

- Windows with Python 3.12/3.13 and Tkinter; launch `Start-Surveyor.cmd`.
- `python -m compileall -q tools overlay tests`
- `python -m unittest discover -s tests`
- In Agent Console use **Refresh now** for an immediate poll or select **Off** to pause automatic status and extension checks.

## Latest changes and verification

- v0.3.48 adds main-window overlay display controls, live opacity/position settings, and published agent objectives. v0.3.47 adds visible root-resource and dispatch-capture status plus manual overlay lifecycle controls. v0.3.46 shows exact prerequisites and missing state in NEEDED, adds per-section +/− controls in both windows, and uses cached game/probe state for action readiness.
- `python -m compileall -q tools overlay tests` and the full unittest suite pass (163 tests). Windows visual verification is still needed because Tk cannot be rendered in this Linux workspace.
- Runtime-A’s `Root dispatch +0x10 captured` live event remains unverified; don’t treat exact-root-caller output as proof.

## Rollback and next action

- Roll back the app by reinstalling the previous complete v0.3.44 package. No probe, session, extension API, or saved evidence migration is needed. Extension versions retain their individual rollback controls.
- **Next action:** install v0.3.48 on Windows; verify opacity and position sliders, main-window section toggles, objective updates, and that alpha composition does not affect NMS rendering. Confirm `+0x10` remains pending until a real capture is reported.
