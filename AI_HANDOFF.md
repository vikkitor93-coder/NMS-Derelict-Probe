# NMS Derelict Probe — AI handoff

## Current state

- **Automatic GitHub evidence uploads** are controlled by a remembered checkbox under GitHub / updates. Enabled by default: a new persisted root capture is uploaded automatically, and after a research or lane action the Surveyor uploads a deduplicated all-lanes evidence batch if its contents changed. The lane-specific action upload remains part of its explicit action workflow. Uncheck the option to stop background root and shared-batch uploads; manual uploads remain available. The all-lanes fingerprint receipt is stored under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NMSDerelictSurveyor`.
- **Upload all saved evidence** snapshots every existing research output declared by `ACTION_OUTPUTS` into one deduplicated `research-uploads/<timestamp>-all-saved-evidence-<id>/` folder on `main`. Its manifest lists which actions produced each file and marks it visible to all four lanes. The Surveyor writes a receipt to each lane card after success. This is a shared repository upload, not an automatic agent notification or a write to their status branches.
- Overlapping local `*-latest` outputs: `generation-baseline-latest.json` (measure/analyze-generation), `generation-measurements-summary.json` and `generation-measurements.csv` (measure/compare-measurements), `seed-room-correlation.json` (measure/analyze-correlation), and `exact-root-caller-latest.json` (analyze-generation/Runtime-A upload). Local latest files are replaced by a producer rerun; GitHub uploads are timestamped snapshots.
- Runtime-A can now upload its already-persisted root event after closing NMS via **Upload captured root event**; this panel action needs only the saved capture and an idle Surveyor workflow.
- Current source package: **v0.3.57**. Runtime-A probe is **0.3.36**; it samples owner+0x10 at the shared logical-entry hook after the external dispatch call, preserves the value through recursive entries, and separately records the later root-resource-add sample. Each sample has a phase and timestamp. Target module identity is resolved from the entry-time raw value when the exact root event is correlated. Live Windows/NMS verification is still required; no semantic meaning is claimed from the address alone.
- Runtime-A current evidence remains `research-uploads/20261004T101244Z-all-saved-evidence-2a766630/`: the delayed owner+0x10 read was zero 1.383 ms after the matched logical-entry record. New main package v0.3.56 still performs the slot read only at root addition; v0.3.57 candidate moves the sample to logical entry. Root seed `5B4AE67D9C2A8F61` remains unverified.
- Surveyor does not redistribute DerelictFreighterFarming files. Download your own archive and use **Install Derelict Farming archive** in the GitHub / updates section. The installer accepts only three expected EXML files, validates their XML, stages them under `GAMEDATA/MODS/DerelictFreighterFarming`, and preserves conflicts. Roll back with `python tools/github_integration.py rollback-derelict-farming`. The supplied archive targets 7.04; NMS 7.05 behavior is not yet validated.
- Agent Console has four side-by-side lane cards. The fixed **NEEDED** box shows the published request, actual extension action, exact required prerequisite keys, and which prerequisites are currently missing. It does not contain generic step guidance. The actual host key is `probe.connected` (fresh probe heartbeat), not `probe.running`; the v1 extension contract is unchanged.
- Installed/published/reported versions remain immediately under NEEDED. Each evidence receipt checkbox stays fixed below its lane buttons.
- Compact top-right +/− controls collapse each major main-window section, each Agent Console card, lane action groups, and global action group. The controls and content begin expanded; lane/global buttons remain pinned in the bottom strip. Agent Console display toggles and refresh interval persist in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NMSDerelictSurveyor\agent-console-options.json`.
- Auto-refresh defaults to one minute; choices are 20 seconds, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, or Off. **Refresh now** fetches status and extension index immediately. Network reads run on background threads; cache-busted lane status requests remain read-only.
- Polling reuses unchanged extension widgets and action readiness uses the main window’s latest NMS/probe status instead of launching new process checks per lane, keeping scroll position stable and refresh work lighter.
- The overlay display toggles now live in the main Surveyor window; opacity and horizontal/vertical placement sliders apply live. Agent objectives come from the published status snapshot, and the overlay shows root-detected completion plus “waiting for upload / don’t close game” where applicable. `Root dispatch +0x10` now reports the raw slot value and best-effort module identity when a read succeeds; its meaning remains unproven until live evidence is reviewed.
- Main Status and the in-game overlay now show the exact root resource path and observed event count. `Root dispatch +0x10` is shown separately and uses the capture field emitted by Runtime-A probe 0.3.34.
- **Start overlay** and **Stop overlay** sit beside the existing **Game overlay** auto-start toggle. Stop closes the titled overlay window and signals the local stop-request file, including overlays started by the NMS launcher.
- The package carries DUNGEON-C 1.0.2, Metadata-D 1.0.1, Runtime-A 1.0.1, and Seed-B 1.0.2, with prior installed versions retained for rollback. The Runtime-A panel stays data-only; its analyze/upload action is unchanged.

## Purpose and architecture

Reverse engineer No Man’s Sky abandoned-freighter generation using static and runtime evidence while keeping Surveyor independent from the game. `tools/surveyor_controller.py` is the Windows Tk app and action host; `mod/derelict_baseline_probe.py` collects read-only process evidence; `overlay/derelict_overlay.py` formats live status. `tools/agent_console.py` reads public GitHub lane status. `tools/agent_ui_extensions.py` validates and installs data-only JSON panels.

## Contracts, configuration, and diagnostics

- Start with `Start-Surveyor.cmd` / `Start-Surveyor.ps1`; Surveyor can run independently of NMS.
- Agent status uses schema v1 (`schema/agent-status-v1.schema.json`) from `agent-patches/<lane>/STATUS.json`; optional progress, blockers, extension version, and human-action fields are backward-compatible. Agent lanes publish status commits at meaningful milestones.
- Extension panels use shared UI host API 1.0 and hash-checked `manifest.json`/`panel.json` entries indexed by `agent-ui/extensions/index.json`. Extensions may call only registered host action IDs; no supplied shell or Python runs. Receipts are display-only and never lock actions.
- Session/live status schemas and probe/overlay command protocol remain v1. No data migration is required.
- Controller and workflow logs: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NMSDerelictSurveyor\gui-actions\`; live status: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NMSDerelictSurveyor\live-status.json`.
- Agent Console settings remain in its local options JSON. Overlay display settings live in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NMSDerelictSurveyor\overlay-settings.json`; the current objective snapshot is `overlay-objectives.json`.

## Build, run, and test

- Windows with Python 3.12/3.13 and Tkinter; launch `Start-Surveyor.cmd`.
- `python -m compileall -q tools overlay tests`
- `python -m unittest discover -s tests`
- In Agent Console use **Refresh now** for an immediate poll or select **Off** to pause automatic status and extension checks.

## Latest changes and verification

- v0.3.56 adds a persistent auto-upload toggle. When on, saved Runtime-A captures upload automatically and changed all-lanes evidence is published after research/agent workflows. Batch fingerprints prevent repeated uploads of identical saved files.
- v0.3.54 persists the complete runtime root event, metadata, and universe address in the existing atomically saved/uploaded capture artifact; schema and upload path remain compatible.
- v0.3.48 adds main-window overlay display controls, live opacity/position settings, and published agent objectives. v0.3.47 adds visible root-resource and dispatch-capture status plus manual overlay lifecycle controls. v0.3.46 shows exact prerequisites and missing state in NEEDED, adds per-section +/− controls in both windows, and uses cached game/probe state for action readiness.
- `python -m compileall -q tools overlay tests mod` and the full unittest suite passed for v0.3.51 (173 tests). Windows pyMHF/NMS live validation is still required for the new capture.
- Runtime-A’s new capture implementation is present in probe 0.3.34, but live Windows/NMS validation and semantic interpretation remain pending; exact-root-caller output alone is not proof of a slot read.

## Rollback and next action

- Roll back the app by reinstalling the previous complete v0.3.49 package. Roll back the installed farming mod with `python tools/github_integration.py rollback-derelict-farming`. No probe, session, extension API, or saved evidence migration is needed. Extension versions retain their individual rollback controls.
- **Next action:** update Surveyor, select your downloaded mod ZIP with **Install Derelict Farming archive**, fully restart NMS, then test repeat derelicts in the same system. Confirm `+0x10` remains pending until a real capture is reported.
